My data was recorded manually from various experiments I did for my final project. I wrote a code generator (codeGenerator.py) that would output viz.js and viz.html based on the data I recorded (star_results.csv). It creates a table for each classifier/dataset pair. The table shows the accuracy of each subdataset, denoted (type of ngram, number of reviews trained). For example, (2, 100) is the subdataset of bigrams and unigrams of 100 reviews.

Some background information: my final project is predicting # of stars given the text of a review. The experiments I did was based on various classifiers (naive bayes, svm, decision tree, random decision forests) and on various datasets (varying on n-grams, and whether or not it was restricted to reviews only in restaurants). The data I recorded was based on these experiments and consists of the accuracy obtained by the classifier/dataset pair.
